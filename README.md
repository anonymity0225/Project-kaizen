## Project Overview

**ProjectKaizen** aims to empower small businesses by allowing them to build machine learning models on their own data without extensive technical expertise. By automating key steps such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, ProjectKaizen provides a seamless experience for creating customized predictive models.

This project currently supports both **classification** and **regression** tasks, with options for data scaling, encoding, feature engineering, model evaluation, and more.

## Features

- **Data Transformation**: Normalizes, scales, and encodes data for better model performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Automatically generates polynomial and date-based features and selects important ones.
- **Automated Model Building**: Includes multiple regression and classification algorithms.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses grid search and other methods for parameter optimization.
- **Model Evaluation**: Generates evaluation metrics based on the selected model type (classification or regression).
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Users can choose the type of model (classification or regression) and select options tailored to their dataset.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProjectKaizen.git

## Usage
ProjectKaizen is aimed at being used by smaller and newer businesses so as to help them improve their present standing without the use of expensive analytics or cheap and subpar alternatives.
ProjectKaizen aims to drive out the existing gap between advanced analytics and expensive services.
